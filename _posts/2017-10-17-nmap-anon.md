If you work in the infosec industry and never asked yourself this question, please take your time to think. Our objective here is to accomplish a full scan without revealing our real IP to the target.

# Anonymizing an nmap scan

There are multiple ways to accomplish this noble mission. One way would be to execute an [Idle Scan](https://nmap.org/book/idlescan.html), aka ["the ultimate stealth scan"](https://nmap.org/book/idlescan.html#idm140153167240176).

Another idea is just to use proxies or even TOR. Although nmap offers a `--proxy` option, [it should be noted that](https://nmap.org/book/man-bypass-firewalls-ids.html):

~~~
Warning: this feature is still under development and has limitations. It is implemented within the nsock library and thus has no effect on the ping, port scanning and OS discovery phases of a scan. Only NSE and version scan benefit from this option so farâ€”other features may disclose your true address. SSL connections are not yet supported, nor is proxy-side DNS resolution (hostnames are always resolved by Nmap).
~~~

Well, it does not give us much of an option instead of not trusting this feature, does it? Then we present you another solution: proxychains.

# What does proxychains do (and does not)?

According to the [package description](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/proxychains)

~~~
proxy chains - redirect connections through proxy servers

Proxy chains force any tcp connection made by any given tcp client to follow through proxy (or proxy chain). It is a kind of proxifier. It acts like sockscap / premeo / eborder driver ( intercepts TCP calls ) 

This version supports SOCKS4, SOCKS5 and HTTP CONNECT proxy servers. Different proxy types can be mixed in the same chain. 
~~~

Another thing to note in [here](http://proxychains.sourceforge.net/):

    [Proxychains] Allows TCP and DNS tunneling through proxies. 

These are the two protocols we are going to "secure" while using proxychains. Keep in mind that all other protocols might pose a hazard to your anonimity.


**Please do check your proxychains version before using it**


The latest version of this tool according to the [SourceForge page](http://proxychains.sourceforge.net/):

~~~
ProxyChains README 
current version: 3.1
======================
~~~~

However, there is a [very well starred repo in GitHub](https://github.com/haad/proxychains) that declares:

    ProxyChains ver. 4.2.0 README

Now, according to [proxychain's man page in Debian 9](https://man.cx/proxychains) (and Kali therefore):

~~~~
This version (2.0) supports SOCKS4, SOCKS5 and HTTP CONNECT proxy servers.  Auth-types: socks - "user/pass" , http - "basic".
~~~~

WTF Debian?! To be sure this is just an outdated manpage I checked the package informations:

~~~
$ apt show proxychains
Package: proxychains
Version: 3.1-7
~~~
So yeah, it seems ok. The main difference between versions 2 and 3 is the support for DNS requests (which is something really important). Anyway, you should check your version and run some local tests just in case.

# nmap scan phases

I am assuming here you are familiarized with it. If not, refer to [this page](https://nmap.org/book/nmap-phases.html). All an all, the phases are:

1. Script pre-scanning
2. Target enumeration
3. Host discovery (ping scanning)
4. Reverse-DNS resolution
5. Port scanning
6. Version detection
7. OS detection
8. Traceroute
9. Script scanning
10. Output
11. Script post-scanning

# What is a ping to nmap?

First point to make clear is the concept of *ping* in nmap's terminology:

So let it be clear once and for all:

    Ping in daily network lingo is a *program* that uses ICMP to "send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts". 
    Ping in nmap lingo is any request done in the host discovery phase (**not necessarily ICMP**).

Ping scan therefore uses multiple protocols besides ICMP. Keep that in mind.
Now we know the difference between these two guys, we may move on.

# Proxychains

Our proxychains config is set to use SOCKS5 protocol in order to tunnel our requests through the TOR network. Our TOR client is listening in port 9050 for that matter. This is the default configuration for proxychains, so lets keep it this way.

# Leaks in Host Discovery

Since we can only use TCP and DNS within Proxychains, we must disable all other protocols used in Host Discovery phase. According to the Nmap Network Scanning Guide:

~~~
Note that if you specify any of the -P options discussed in this section, they *replace* the default discovery probes rather than adding to them.
~~~

So if we want to skip any UDP or ICMP packets in host discovery and stick only to TCP probes, it should be enough to add the -PS option. This should orverrule all the other ping types.

But no luck this time! In fact, we can check whether our host is probing the target directly:

Two SYN pings from our host to the target, no proxy. Bad bad OPSEC, folks.

Since proxychains is not tunneling our ping scan, even when we use SYN scan only, how can we avoid leaking our IP during the host discovery phase? Simple: skip it! Make sure the target host is up using some other method and then go for the scanning phase.

In conclusion, it is not safe to go through the host discovery phase when using proxychains.

# Leaks in DNS resolution

This time we are concerned with leaking our IP address through DNS requests. Let's begin with a simple TCP scan:

~~~
# proxychains nmap -Pn -sT -p80 www.google.com -vv
ProxyChains-3.1 (http://proxychains.sf.net)

~~~

The DNS request was correctly made through proxychains, which is using TOR. Strangely, nmap interprets 216.58.214.228/0 as an IPv6 address and then breaks. It seems nmap does not get along with our SOCKS5 DNS resolution.

Let's see what happens when we scan the IP address directly, instead of the name:

As you can see, a reverse DNS resolution to Google's DNS server (8.8.8.8) is done without a tunnel. Although we are not leaking our IP directly to the target, it still is being leaked. Confirming with tcpdump:

~~~~

Due to this situation, it seems wise to use the **-n** option (skip name resolution) when scanning through a proxy.

# What about other scan types?

We have been using so far the infamous -sT (SYN scan). In fact, -sS is the default scan when running as *root*, while -sT is the default scan for unprivileged users. But what about -sS under proxychains?
