Pwnable.kr is not exactly easy even when they say it is. Despite this scary introduction, this specifically challenge is not that hard.

Papa brought me a packed present! let's open it.

Download : http://pwnable.kr/bin/flag

This is reversing task. all you need is binary
~~~~

Please note the first sentence of the text: "Papa brought me a **packed** present!". Here lies the key to solve it.
After downloading the binary, let's do a sanity check:

~~~~
$ file flag
flag: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, stripped
~~~~

Since the file is a stripped ELF, there is no use in running gdb in order to disassemble *main()* or anything like that. After all, our symbol table is far gone.

One hint was given in the statement of the chall. *Packing*. Packing is used, among other things, to obfuscate a binary. It basically compresses the binary and adds a decompression routine, so you get your full binary in memory only when you run it. Let's search for compression signs:

~~~~
$ strings flag | grep pack
$Info: This file is packed with the UPX executable packer http://upx.sf.net $
~~~~

I think this answers our question :) *UPX* is one of the most commonly used packer for executables. in order to unpack it I had to first get UPX:

~~~~
$ wget -q https://github.com/upx/upx/releases/download/v3.92/upx-3.92-amd64_linux.tar.xz
$ unxz -d upx-3.92-amd64_linux.tar.xz
$ tar -xvf upx-3.92-amd64_linux.tar
$ cd upx-3.92-amd64_linux.tar
$ ./upx -d /PATH_TO/flag

Unpacked 1 file.

And now:

~~~~
file flag 
flag: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=96ec4cc272aeb383bd9ed26c0d4ac0eb5db41b16, not stripped
~~~~

Not stripped! Fire up your gdb :D

So it is basically giving us the flag at address 0x6c2070. Ok, then...

~~~~
gdb-peda$ x/s \*0x6c2070
0x496628:   "UPX...? sounds like a delivery service :)"
~~~~

There you go!
